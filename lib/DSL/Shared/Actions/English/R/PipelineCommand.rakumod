# The methods here are most likely going to be over-written with concrete pipeline code conventions.

use v6;

unit module DSL::Shared::Actions::English::R::PipelineCommand;

class DSL::Shared::Actions::English::R::PipelineCommand {

    # Pipeline command
    method pipeline-command($/) { make $/.values[0].made; }
    method take-pipeline-value($/) { make 'obj'; }
    method echo-pipeline-value($/) { make 'print(obj)'; }

    method echo-command($/) { make 'print( ' ~ $<echo-message-spec>.made ~ ' )'; }
    method echo-message-spec($/) { make $/.values[0].made; }
    method echo-words-list($/) { make '"' ~ $<variable-name>>>.made.join(' ') ~ '"'; }
    method echo-variable($/) { make $/.Str; }
    method echo-text($/) { make $/.Str; }
}
